- Data:
  - `Data for Fig. 2.xlsx` contains the data for plotting Figure 2. The 2280-km-long Jinsha River is divided into 1140 2-km-long river segments. The table includes the following information of each river segment: (1) River segment No. (each 2 km); (2) Distance from upstream; (3) Valley floor width; (4) Damming probability; (5) Upstream watershed area; (6) Annual mean flow rate; (7) Meteorological design floods with different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year).
  - `Jinsha River shapefile.zip` contains the shapefile of the entire Jinsha River. The 2280-km-long Jinsha River is divided into 1140 2-km-long river segments. The features associated with all the river reaches also included in the attribute table.
  - `Data for Fig. 3.xlsx` contains the data for plotting Figure 3. The 2280-km-long Jinsha River is divided into 228 10-km-long river segments. The table includes the following information of each river segment: (1) River segment No. (each 10 km); (2) Distance from upstream; (3) Meteorological design floods with different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year); (4) Amplified design floods with different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year); (5) Design Flood Amplification Index with different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year).
