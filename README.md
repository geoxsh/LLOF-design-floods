# LLOF Design Floods Repository

This repository houses the data supporting the findings of our paper.

## Contents

- **Data:**
  - `Data for Fig. 2.xlsx`: This file includes the data necessary for creating Figure 2. The Jinsha River, which spans 2280 km, is broken down into 1140 segments, each 2 km long. The table provides details for each segment, including: (1) River segment No. (each 2 km); (2) Distance from upstream; (3) Valley floor width; (4) Damming probability; (5) Upstream watershed area; (6) Annual mean flow rate; (7) Meteorological design floods for different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year).
  - `Jinsha River shapefile.zip` contains the shapefile of the entire Jinsha River. The 2280-km-long Jinsha River is divided into 1140 2-km-long river segments. The attribute table also includes the features associated with all the river segments, as detailed in the `Data for Fig. 2.xlsx` file.
  - `Data for Fig. 3.xlsx`: This file comprises the data required for plotting Figure 3. The Jinsha River, spanning 2280 km, is divided into 228 segments, each 10 km in distance. The table includes: (1) River segment No. (each 10 km); (2) Distance from upstream; (3) Meteorological design floods for different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year); (4) Amplified design floods for different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year); (5) Design Flood Amplification Index (DFAI) for different return periods (10000-year, 1000-year, 100-year, 50-year).
